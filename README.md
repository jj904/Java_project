## Defining the Problem
* There are currently little to no free apps for splitting bills conveniently. 
* 65% of young adults use cash apps to exchange money between friends (Mint), but there are little to no free apps for splitting bills conveniently.
* People often do not split bills right away and receipts compile → painstaking calculations later on
* Many young adults are limited in money and must live on a budget, they are not able to easily split 50/50 on expenses with friends.

## Vision
* A bill splitting app, “Splitty”, can allow people on a budget to conveniently split multiple bills at a time by items and people involved.
* Users shall be able to automatically send or request money after splitting with the app’s integration of Venmo or PayPal (the most popular cash apps).
* Every person involved of a split transaction shall receive an4 itemized receipt including a list of the total costs they owe to other people and/or what others owe them.
* Domain (or Scope)
    - People with smartphones that are on a budget.
